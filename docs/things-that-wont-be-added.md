### Non-Music Commands/Features
JMusicBot only concentrates on musically-related features and commands. As a result, functions that are not related to music, including picture generating or moderation, will not be included. It is advised to search the Discord Bots website for acceptable possibilities if a user needs a bot that does not just play music (https://discord.bots.gg).

### Spotify
For three main reasons, JMusicBot is unable to support playing Spotify songs. For off, retrieving songs from Spotify would require a separate API key, making the bot more difficult to operate and maybe confusing for certain users. Second, because direct streaming from Spotify is not allowed, the bot would have to guess and play the closest YouTube match, which would produce inconsistent results. Finally, Spotify synchronization is already supported natively by Discord.

### Features Requiring Additional API Keys
As previously mentioned, JMusicBot does not support features that call for additional API keys, such as Spotify. Some users may find it difficult to obtain and configure other keys than a Discord bot token, and in most cases, there are better online solutions accessible.
